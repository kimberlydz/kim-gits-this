            I wanted to be efficient about creating a vector file with 20 3" triangles, and started with creating this grid of 3" squares. My bad.

            I quickly switched to focus on creating one 3x3 triangle with accurate laser-cut guides. The cardboard I planned to use was 290mm thick, but when I added a cut out of that dim to my triangle it felt much to wide relative to the area of the triangleâ€”which indicated to me that if I proceeded I'd have trouble with construction. So I went dumpster diving for thinner card board.

            The new proportions looked better. I made my cuts 1mm smaller than my cardboard measured for a snug fit.
