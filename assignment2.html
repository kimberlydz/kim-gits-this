            <p>I searched online for concepts based on a triangle shape.<br>
              I found this pic of a beautiful form accredited to Gearge W. Hart<br>
              and featured in a Quarky Science blog post.

            <p>
            Referring to details about the individual piece provided in the blog post,I went to work<br>
            creating a vector grid to get the 20 triangles I needed = totally wrong geometry...My bad.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            I quickly abandoned the grid to focus on creating the one piece I needed, a 3" equilateral triangle.<br>
            I added a 1" red rule to help me accurately place the required notches 1" from each corner. Using a<br>
            digital kaliper I learned my cardboard was 3mm thick, but when I added a notch of that dim to my triangle<br>
            it seemed much to wide relative to the area of the triangle—which indicated to me that if I proceeded with<br>
            3mm cardboard I'd have trouble with construction. So I went dumpster diving for thinner card board and<br>
            hopefully more elegant solution in the end.

            </p>
            <p>
            My new found cardboard was .90mm thick and now the notch-cut-outs looked proportionately right. I reduced the<br>
            width to .89mm to ensure a snug fit. Next I trimmed my cardboard to match the size of my vector file.

            Following the cheat sheet Joshua provided set-up for the 32x18 CO2 laser cutter went smoothly. I set the beam at<br>
            25-speed, 25-power, 50-frequency, which turned out to be perfect for my .90 board. I confirmed settings were correct<br>
            with a staff member before I hit print. It was super fun to see the laser in action on my first project.

            I immediatelytested assembly making a first layer of the polyhedra on site<br>
            at maker space, the fit was easy but snug:YAY.

            Constructing it was not obvious. I could quickly tell a wrong move when the<br>
            negative space created by combining triangle pieces was something other than a hexagon.

            <p>
          I didn't realize when I started this project that I'd end up with a final form<br>
          containing hexagon, pentagon and triangles.We talk alot about creating a "delightful<br>
          experience" in UX but rarely have I been as delighted as I was making this.
