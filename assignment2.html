            <p>I searched for concepts based on the triangle shape

            I wanted to be efficient about creating a vector file with 20, equilateral 3" triangles, and started with creating this grid of 3" squares. My bad.

            I quickly switched to focus on creating one 3"x3" triangle with accurate laser-cut guides. The cardboard I planned to use was 3mm thick, but when I added a cut out of that dim to my triangle it seemed much to wide relative to the area of the triangle—which indicated to me that if I proceeded I'd have trouble with construction. So I went dumpster diving for thinner card board.

            The new .90mm cut-outs looked proportionately right. I made my cuts a fraction smaller than my cardboard for a snug fit.

              Set up went smoothly—it was super fun to see the laser in action on my first project. I set the beam  at 25/25/50, which turned out to  be perfect for .90 board.
