            <p>I searched online for concepts based on a triangle shape. I found this pic of a beautiful form accredited to Gearge W. Hart and featured in a Quarky Science blog post.

            Referring to details about the individual piece provided in the blog post, I went to work creating a vector grid to get the 20 triangles I needed = totally wrong geometry...My bad.

            I quickly abandoned the grid to focus on creating the one piece I needed, a 3" equilateral triangle. I added a 1" red rule to help me accurately place the required notches 1" from each corner. Using a digital kaliper I learned my cardboard was 3mm thick, but when I added a notch of that dim to my triangle it seemed much to wide relative to the area of the triangleâ€”which indicated to me that if I proceeded with 3mm cardboard I'd have trouble with construction. So I went dumpster diving for thinner card board and hopefully more elegant solution in the end.

            My new found cardboard was .90mm thick and now the notch-cut-outs looked proportionately right. I reduced the width to .89mm to ensure a snug fit. Next I trimmed my cardboard to match the size of my vector file.

            Following the cheat sheet, set-up for the 18x36 CO2 laser cutter went smoothly. I set the beam at 25-speed, 25-power, 50-frequency, which turned out to be perfect for my .90 board. I confirmed settings were correct with a staff member before I hit print. It was super fun to see the laser in action on my first project.
