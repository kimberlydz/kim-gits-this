            <p>I began sketching ideas for a lamp shade that could be affixed to the pendant style electrical component I found at World Cost Plus.<br>

            <img src="1_MakingCylinder.png" width=600></a><img src="4_RhinoCylinder.png" width=625></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            After taking all of the measurements I might need for fitting a shade on to the electrical componenet I started to create a shape in Rhino.<br>
            I began with a cylinder and then switched to a Circle geometry. I extruded the circle shape, capped it and then created a new identical shape<br>
            except it was slightly smaller, and used the smaller shape to delete the interior of my solid cylinder leaving a 3 dimensional can for the basis<br>
            of my lamp shade.

            </p>
            When I showed my shape to classmates at the Mill where I was working, they strongly advised I redesign my 3d solution to make it much smaller<br>
            because they estimated my"can" shape would take 8 hours to print.I went back to my sketch pad and modified my design by removing the sides.<br>
            I created a new file in Rhino this time using the cylnder geometry to create a disc.

            </p>
            <p>
            I opened my Rhino file in Dremel, to be read for 3d printing. It took 2.5 hours to print this disc/lamp component in <br>
            the 3d printer. ALARMING:It appeared the filament had seeped to make the apertures for inserting my laser pieces to narrow!<br>
            <br>
            MEANWHILE I went shopping for material for the laser pieces of the lamp shade at the front desk.I chose a translucent blue <br>
            acrylic because it looked best with my gray filament color.<br>
            <br>
            I designed the "shade" piecies in AIâ€”omg So easy LOL.I put the file on the Mill computer and chose settings of 5/speed, 100 <br>
            for both frequency/power.I tested before printing on a scrap.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            The pieces dropped out with no effort,perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            Now the scary part : Will the acrylic and filament components fit together??? <br>
            <br>
            <img src="checkingfit.JPG" width=600></a>
            <br>
            With putting on some pressure and wiggling they did : YAY. NO WAY this will come apart! I also inserted the lighting element<br>
            which fit as intended.

            Assembled before adding lighting component.

           SHOUT OUT THANK YOU to colleague Andrew and the rest of the Monday afternoon crew who shared <br>
           as they learned which printers were unreliable and other tips.
