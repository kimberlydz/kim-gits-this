            <p>I began sketching ideas for a lamp shade that could be affixed to the pendant style electrical component I found at World Cost Plus.<br>

            </p>
            <p>
            After taking all of the measurements I might need for fitting a shade on to the electrical componenet I started to create a shape in Rhino.
            I began with a cylinder and then switched to a Circle geometry. I extruded the circle shape, capped it and then created a new identical shape
            except it was slightly smaller, and used the smaller shape to delete the interior of my solid cylinder leaving a 3 dimensional can for the basis
            of my lamp shade.

            </p>
            When I showed my shape to classmates at the Mill where I was working, they strongly advised I redesign my 3d solution to make it much smaller
            because they estimated my "can" shape would take 8 hours to print.I went back to my sketch pad and modified my design by removing the sides. I created
            a new file in Rhino this time using the cylnder geometry to create a disc.

            I abandoned the square and first created the circle piece in GH, and then a hexagon using the polygon component.<br>
            For both shapes I proceeded as follows:<br>
            <br>
            -I assigned a Radius parameter defining a maximum of width.<br>
            -Rectangle component<br>
            -Number slider each for X and Y dimensions attached with the X and Y ports of the Rectangle.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            RELOCATING RECTANGLE ON THE SPHERE AND ABILITY TO RE-SIZE ELEMENTS<br>
            I was challenged to understand these next computational relationships which are required to create <br>
            radiating notches around the sphere—AND have the ability to change the geometry(rectangles and sphere)<br>
            simultaneously maintaining relativity of measurements or/and also— change dim's independently of one another.<br>
            With my colleagues help I achieved this as follows:<br>
            <br>
            MOVING RECTANGLE:<br>

            -I created a Move parameter to adjust rectangle/notch to locate it at the top center of the circle.<br>
            -added a X/Y Vector component to tell the rectangle which direction to move along<br>
            -I added a Subtract parameter to which I attached the Circle geometry and the Y dimension of the Rectangle.<br>
            <br>
            CHANGING DIMENSIONS RELATIVELY<br>

            -added a Multiply parameter<br>
            -and attached both a Number Slider and Number Parameter (which dictated the increment of the sldier)<br>
             to the above Multiply parameter.
             -I joined the Multiply parameter to the X/Y Vector parameter.<br>
             <br>
             At this point I attached the entire geometry to the Move parameter: attaching the Rectangle to the Geometry port<br>
             and the Vector to the T (motion) port. Which I then connected to a Polar Array parameter.<br>
             -A number slider was necessary to indictate the range of number of items in the polar array.<br>
             <br>
             The last step was creating the negative space of the notch by connecting the Polar Array rectangles and the<br>
             Sphere to a Region Difference component.

           I played with resizing the dimensions of my hexagon within Grasshopper.It worked:YAY. <br>
           I next exported a single shape to AI.<br>

           <p>
           I had an issue initially but solved it by changing units to inches vs. of mm.

           </p>
           -I uploaded my AI file to the Mill lap top and proceeded to print.

           </p>
           <p>Despite my AI file matching the size of my board(s),<br>
           with the hexagon I had a problem. Adjusting the positioning of the laser did NOT solve the problem. I re-hit print on the computer,<br>
           and this time it aligned and cut my shapes as defined in my AI file. <br>
