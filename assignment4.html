            <p>I began sketching ideas for a lamp shade that could be affixed to the pendant style electrical component I found at World Cost Plus.<br>

            </p>
            <p>
            After taking all of the measurements I might need for fitting a shade on to the electrical componenet I started to create a shape in Rhino.<br>
            I began with a cylinder and then switched to a Circle geometry. I extruded the circle shape, capped it and then created a new identical shape<br>
            except it was slightly smaller, and used the smaller shape to delete the interior of my solid cylinder leaving a 3 dimensional can for the basis<br>
            of my lamp shade.

            </p>
            When I showed my shape to classmates at the Mill where I was working, they strongly advised I redesign my 3d solution to make it much smaller<br>
            because they estimated my"can" shape would take 8 hours to print.I went back to my sketch pad and modified my design by removing the sides.<br>
            I created a new file in Rhino this time using the cylnder geometry to create a disc.
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            It took 2.5 hours to print this disc/lamp component in the 3d printer. ALARMING:It appeared the filament had seeped to make the apertures for<br>
            inserting my laser pieces to narrow!<br>
            <br>
            MEANWHILE I went shopping for material for the laser pieces of the lamp shade at the front desk.I chose a translucent blue acrylic because it <br>
            looked best with my gray filament color.<br>
            I designed the "shade" piecies in AIâ€”omg So easy LOL.I put the file on the Mill computer and chose settings of 5/speed, 100 for both frequency/power. <br>
            I tested before printing on a scrap.

            </p>
            <p>
            The pieces dropped out with no effort,perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            Now the scary part : Will the acrylic and filament components fit together? <br>
            <br>
            <img src="checkingfit.JPG" width=800></a>
            <br>
            With putting on some pressure and wiggling they did : YAY.<br>
            I also inserted the lighting element which fit as intended.

           <p>
           I played with resizing the dimensions of my hexagon within Grasshopper.It worked:YAY. <br>
           I next exported a single shape to AI.<br>
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
           I had an issue initially but solved it by changing units to inches vs. of mm.

           </p>
           -I uploaded my AI file to the Mill lap top and proceeded to print.

           </p>
           <p>Despite my AI file matching the size of my board(s),<br>
           with the hexagon I had a problem. Adjusting the positioning of the laser did NOT solve the problem. I re-hit print on the computer,<br>
           and this time it aligned and cut my shapes as defined in my AI file. <br>

           THANK YOU to our colleague Ani for his time and excellent guidance.
