            For my final project I designed an Automata. <br/>

            INSPIRATION & GOAL
            <br/><br/>
            I was inspired by a rustic example of an Automata of a pig with wings. My goal is to adapt<br/>
            the same principles to create my an Automata featuring dragonfly wings that appear to flap by<br/>
            the turn of a crank.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        RESEARCH & SKETCHING A PLAN
            With no engineering in my background this required me to analyse the simple mechanics<br/>
            required to cause an upward/downward motion. I would also have to create housing for the mechanism,<br/>
            and the 'thing' to be moved. I worked out solutions by sketching out plans, also looking up and <br/>
            referencing mechanics creating Automata.

            </p>
            <p>
            MOTION <br/>
            • I first attempted a mechanism that had 3 parts, a round "container" to hold the steel <br/>
            rod in place that did not rotate, with a offset cam/cog inserted inside attached to a shaft <br/>
            which rotated when cranked.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • I shifted to a more simple solution shown in the above sketch: basically a "bobber" connected to <br/>
            the rod, rests on top of an offset cam which is fixed to a shaft and turned by a crank.<br/>
            <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
            DESIGN
            <br/>
            After studying dragonfly visuals, I decided I did not want a realistic representation and made a <br/>
            design that reduced the main body to a cube, making the wings and motion the main focus.

            MAKING

            GOAL: 3D print the body cube and the bobber that will be fitted to the base of the steel rod.<br/>
            • I have a steel rod is roughly 1.8  mm thick (sourced from Hobby Town)<br/>
            • In Rhino I make the bobber by creating a circle 10mm in diamter that I extruded and cap. This seems<br/>
            large enough to rest on a 3mm thick cam. I Then create a solid cylinder with dimaeter of 1.20 <br/>
            where the rod will fit in place.<br/><br/>
            With printing it I discover the hole isn't large enough, which informs the aperture I apply to the body-cube.<br/>
            <br/>
            • In Rhino I turn a mesh cube into a solid cube by extruding and capping a rectangle. Then create <br/>
            a solid cylinder with dimaeter of 1.30, where the rod will be inserted. Again, when printing the hole<br/>
            is not large enough. I end up drilling both a bit wider, the result is a loose fit which I think I can<br/>
            make work.<br/><br/>
            GOAL: Lasercut Paper Wings.
            • I plan to use Adobe Illustrator and hope to source a vector file for lace wings online. I hoped to lasercut<br/>
            a very delicate pattern and adapted this vector file of wings by adding a solid area for fitting them <br/>
            onto the rod in "spindle" fashion. These were veto'd by the Mill staff, for being impossibly fine and burning<br/>
            voted likely to burn up when lasercut.<br/>
            <br/>
            I determine I have to create my own pattern and do some more online research for inspiration.<br/>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            GOAL: Lasercut wood fitted box made of 1/8" Alder<br/>
            <br/>
            From a standpoint of time, I take the advice of a classmate and create a pattern with the help of a box-maker.<br/>
            program. I tailor it to my needs and test the fit on a piece of scrap:<br/>
            Size of box: 70mm x 100mm x 70mm<br/>
            Kerf: .007 <br/>
            Rule: 001<br/>
            <br/>
            RESULT: The fit seemed good, but when I printed the Alder,the fit was loose. A kerf issue. Sad.<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            REVIEW & PROBLEM SOLVE
            At this point I have box issues and wing issues. I go back to sketch, re-assess and problem solve.<br/>
            <br/><
            While the box pieces are a fail as a whole, they're actually very helpful for seeing the project as a whole.<br/><br/>
            • I decide to change the dimensions to allow more room for the motion of the offset cam. <br/>
            • I decide to test a .08/.09 kerf.<br/>
            • Researching possible alternatives to paper wings that will work with my low fidelity attachment concept<br/>
            • I decide to pick up some very thin wood that has flex to it.<br/>
            • Brainstorming other ways to attach the wings I play with tiny magnets, and decide they will be useful<br/>
            for exploring an alternative solution to "spindle"-attaching the wings.<br/><br/>
            My to-do list at this point involves a trip to Artist & Craftsman: <br/>
          • Paperclip thickness wire to support wings.<br/>
          • Thin wood and paper stock for wings...Ask about super thin acrylic?<br/>
          • 5mm or 3/8 inch wood dowel<br/>
          • <br/><br/>
          NEXT MAKER STEPS<br/>
          <br/>
          BOX: Adjust AI files and test for various Kerf to achieve a fit. Create a new pattern reflecting increased<br/>
          height, adding hole for crankshaft.<br/>
          <br/>
          CAM: Create pattern and make from same wood as box.
          <br/>
          Crankshaft: Create knob or crank handle to fit on end of shaft, planning for wood but a large bead would be cool.<br/>
          Create pattern for 4 wood washers to keep shaft from slipping side to side horizontally. Create a pattern<br/>
