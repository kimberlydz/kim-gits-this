            <p>I love gear mechanisms—the above is my inspiration for the direction I took for this project.<br>
              However I didn't start here! I spent a few hours looking for moving parts concepts online and<br>
              found inspiration in a toy conveyer belt. I abandoned the project because of time and all the pieces<br>
              involved, but not before I created the below in OnShape. Building this actually helped me begin to <br>
              learn basic Onshape.

            Toy conveyer belt inspiration. I sketeched ideas for modernizing the design and sketched-out the parts. I created the roller using the revolve tool.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            At this point I pivoted to focus on making moving gears

              I began with a open source file for a spur gear and then made changes to the overall size, number of teeth, and height/extrusion.
              I measured the "pin" using a caliper and created a center hole = 5.85mm, 2mm larger than the rod to ensure the base would fit through the opening.
            <br>
            <br>
            MEANWHILE I went shopping for material for the laser pieces of the lamp shade at the front desk.I chose a translucent blue <br>
            acrylic because it looked best with my gray filament color.<br>
            <br>
            I designed the "shade" piecies in AI—omg So easy LOL.I put the file on the Mill computer and chose settings of 5/speed, 100 <br>
            for both frequency/power.I tested before printing on a scrap.

            </p>
            <p>
            The pieces dropped out with no effort,perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            Now the scary part : Will the acrylic and filament components fit together??? <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            With putting on some pressure and wiggling they did : YAY. NO WAY this will come apart! I also inserted the lighting element<br>
            which fit as intended.

            Assembled before adding lighting component.

           SHOUT OUT THANK YOU to colleague Andrew and the rest of the Monday afternoon crew who shared <br>
           as they learned which printers were unreliable and other tips.
