            <p>I love gear mechanismsâ€”the above is my inspiration for the direction I took for this project.<br>
              However I didn't start here! I spent a few hours looking for moving parts concepts online and<br>
              found inspiration in a toy conveyer belt. I abandoned the project because of time and all the pieces<br>
              involved, but not before I created the below in OnShape. Building this actually helped me begin to <br>
              learn basic Onshape.

            Toy conveyer belt inspiration. I sketeched ideas for modernizing the design and sketched-out the parts. I created the roller using the revolve tool.<br>

            At this point I pivoted to focus on making moving gears instead!
            <p>

              I began with a open source file for a spur gear and then made changes to the overall size, number of teeth, and extrusion height.
              I measured the "pin" using a caliper and created a center hole in the gear 2mm larger than the rod to ensure the base would push through the opening.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before beginning creating a base I sketched how the gears may relate when attached to a base.<br>
            I deliberately wanted to put the circles on square base because I liked juxtaposing the two simple shapes.<br>
            The sketch gave me the dimensions I needed for the base.
            <br>
            The tricky part was identifying exactly where the holes for attaching the 3 gears would be positioned on the base, so that the gears
            would engage and move together. I learned that the _______dimension on a gear sketch specifies the point of contact between two gears.
            By using this dimension I created a the relationship between the gears and was able to be exacting and confident about where to place
            3 holes for the gears.

            The pieces dropped out with no effort,perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            Now the scary part : Will the acrylic and filament components fit together??? <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            With putting on some pressure and wiggling they did : YAY. NO WAY this will come apart! I also inserted the lighting element<br>
            which fit as intended.

           SHOUT OUT THANK YOU to colleague Andrew and the rest of the Monday afternoon crew who shared <br>
           as they learned which printers were unreliable and other tips.
