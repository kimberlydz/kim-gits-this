            <p>I love gear mechanisms—the above is my inspiration for the direction I took for this project.<br>
              However I didn't start here! I spent a few hours looking for moving parts concepts online and<br>
              found inspiration in a toy conveyer belt. I abandoned the project because of time and all the pieces<br>
              involved, but not before I created the below in OnShape. Building this actually helped me begin to <br>
              learn basic Onshape.

            Toy conveyer belt inspiration. I sketeched ideas for modernizing the design and sketched-out the parts. I created the roller using the revolve tool.<br>
            <br>

            </p>
            At this point I pivoted to focus on making moving gears instead!
            <p>
              <br>
              <br>
            <img src="5SpurGEar.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              I began with a open source file for a spur gear and then made changes to the overall size, <br>
              number of teeth, and extrusion height.I measured the "pin" using a caliper and created a center <br>
              hole in the gear 2mm larger than the rod to ensure the base would push through the opening.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before beginning creating a base I sketched how the gears may relate when attached to a base.<br>
            I deliberately wanted to put the circles on square base because I liked juxtaposing the two simple shapes.<br>
            The sketch gave me the dimensions I needed for the base.
            <br>

            </p>

            <img src="5_OnSh-Base.png" width=600></a><img src="" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The tricky part was identifying exactly where the holes for attaching the 3 gears would be <br>
              positioned on the base, so that the gears would engage and move together. I learned that the <br>
              'pitch circle'diameter on a gear sketch specifies the point of contact between two gears.By using this <br>
              dimension I designed the relationship between the gears and was able to be exacting and confident <br>
              about where to place 3 holes for the gears.<br>
            <br>
            Next I converted my OnShape files to two dimension files by exporting as a DXF file.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            I opened the DXF files in AI and prepped for laser cutting. At this point I am deciding what <br>
            materials to use. I end up choosing a compressed particle board: at $3 it fit my price point, <br>
            at 12x12" searched I only needed one piece—AND-conceptually I liked the tone on tone solution.

           </p>
            I set the laser cutter to speed 6 and power 100—and cut with no issues.

            Assembled and...

           SHOUT OUT THANK YOU to colleague LEO for advising me to simplify my goals and Joshua for <br>
           educating me about the nuances of gear math!<br>
