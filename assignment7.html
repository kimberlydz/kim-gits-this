              The goal of this assignment is to create a mold for a plaster casting. The steps include <br/>
              first creating a mold from wax, to be used to create a mold from silicon, to be used for <br/>
              creating the object of desire in plaster.
              <br/>
              <br/>I looked for inspiration on Thingaverse. Thinking about the movement of the milling <br/>
              bit, I searched for ideas that didn't include an overhanging ledge. I chose a pyramid <br/>
              because of it's top down unfolding nature.

            </p>
            <p>
            I downloaded the pyramid files from thingaverse and opened the native STL file in Rhino, <br/>
            where I had created a 3d mesh container that matched the size of a block of wax I intended <br/>
            to mill.
            <br/>
            <br/>
             In Rhino, I placed the pyramid inside my mesh container,in contact with its base. <br/>
             As a 'whole', I exported the file as a 3dm file, one step toward manifesting the file <br/>
             in G-Code, a language that the milling machine can interpret to carve my wax mold.<br/>

             <br/><br/>

            </p>
            <p>
            I opened my STL file in Fusion 360 where I was able to simulate a <br/>
            milling tool path. Nadia who was the makerspace viewed my pyramid shape <br/>
            and made the observaton that my pyramid had detailing the milling tool <br/>
            and motion would not be able to render.

            </p>
            <p>
            I sourced a new file and repeated the same process with the more simple  <br/>
          3D pyramid structure pictured above.(by TK3DPrinting)

            </p>
            In order to open my pyramid at the correct dimensions I went "insert>mesh".  <br/>
            In its initial state, the solids field in Fusion, did not align with my model. <br/>

            </p>
            <p>
            I didn't notate how I solved it in the moment and can't be certain now<br/>
            —but believe it was a simple input "Mesh" in Fusion "Set Up" window not a Rhino file issue.  <br/>
            (An engineering student working nearby believed the problem was the mesh nature  <br/>
            of Rhino—and that a solid is theintended file type to be used in Fusion.)

            <p>
              I established the correct milling bit this way: Manager > tool library > local> 1/8" flat.<br/>
              I followed a set up process; Manager > new set up > where I adjusted settings under
              the "set up" and "stock" tabs.

            </p>
            <p>
              I next did the "simulate the tool path" command— in my limited experience appeared to look good!<br/>

            Post processing interpreted my file as G-Code required to for Computer Controlled Milling.<br/>

              I attached my wax to the mill base using hot glue and hit start.<br/>
              <br/>
               I had these many challenges milling the small Bantam mill.<br/>
              • I had to further shave down my wax to allow for mill bit despite having cut it to fit.<br/>
              • Bantam sent an <em></em>rror message that the bit did not have adequate retraction room.<br/>
              • Back at Fusion I adjusted retraction distance with the goal of overriding error<br/>

              • After starting to mill and removing 3/8" of wax I noticed the tool path was misbehaving.<br/>
              • Back at Fusion to re-do simulation of tool path.<br/>
              • Back in Bantam, the error message persisted<br/>
              • Back to fusion where with help I made a more agressive adjustment to retraction distance.<br/>
              • Back to Bantam, I hit the "start" button hoping to override the persisting error message. <br/>


            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Finally I was able to have progress milling. <br/>
              <br/>
              Note! I had to hit the emergency stop when almost to the end, the mill bit ARM (not the mill bit)<br/>
              made contact with my wax and began acting as a drill itself !!!(see the round cut out in my final mold).<br/>
              Hence the "retraction" warning : My wax block was slightly too deep/thick, despite fitting under the mill bit.

            <p>
            I mixed up silicon at home and filled my mold. No issues.

            <p>
            I had a delay in getting plaster and resorted to using a Light weight modeling plaster which worked— <br/>
            however it appears the material consistency wasn't fluid enough to get into the sharp corners.
            <br/>

          Thanks for peer help from Peter, Cindy and Dawn for problem solving. <br>
