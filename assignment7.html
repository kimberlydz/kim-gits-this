              The goal of this assignment is to create a mold for a plaster casting. The steps include <br/>
              first creating a mold from wax, to be used to create a mold from silicon, to be used for <br/>
              creating the object of desire in plaster.
              <br/>
              <br/>I looked for inspiration on Thingaverse. Thinking about the movement of the milling <br/>
              bit, I searched for ideas that didn't include an overhanging ledge. I chose a pyramid <br/>
              because of it's top down unfolding nature.

            I borrowed the native STL file created by __________from thingaverse and opened it in Rhino, <br/>
            where I had created a 3d mesh container that matched the size of a block of wax I intended <br/>
            to mill.
            <br/>
            <br/>
             In Rhino, I placed the pyramid inside my mesh container,in contact with its base. <br/>
             As a 'whole', I exported the file as a (STl) file, one step toward manifesting the file <br/>
             in G-Code, a language that the milling machine can interpret to carve my wax mold.<br/>

            I opened my STL file in Fusion 360 where I was able to create and see or 'verify' a <br/>
            milling tool path....But PIVOT. Nadia who was the makerspace saw my pyramid shape <br/>
            and made the observaton that my pyramid had tiny detailing, to detailed for the <br/>
            mill process to render.

            <p>
            I started over with looking for a simple iteration of a pyramid. I followed the <br/>
            same steps to produce a milling pattern for the pyramid pictured above.

            Once I opened the new pyramid in Fusion, I had an issue with the box that <br/>
            represents my object area to be milled (I think): it hovered away from my box <br/>
            I wasn't able to figure how to fix this, and was lucky to be at a makerspace where<br/>
            with a student nearby who had a foundation of knowledgeable about Fusion , who was <br/>
            very kind to help BUT even he became very frustrated. He believed the source of the <br/>
            problem was the mesh nature of my stl from Rhino.

            The solve for aligning the area with my file was...

            <p>
              I adjusted settings per instructions shared by Nadia,...

            </p>
            <p>
              and created a tool path that in my limited experience appeared to look good!<br/>
              I exported the G-Code. I attached my wax to the mill base using hot glue and hit start.

              The above and below images of a successful milling operation on a small mill ARE  DECEIVING.<br/>
              •I had to shave my wax down despite having cut it to fit.<br/>
              •I got an error message from Bantam that the bit did not have adequate retraction room.<br/>
              • Back to Fusiong to try to override the error by adjusting retraction (only possible <br/>
              with the help of Nadias <br/>
              • After starting to mill and removing a lot of wax Nadia noticed it wasn't an appropriate tool path.<br/>
              •I had to go back to Fusion and re-establish and verify a new tool path.<br/>
              •Back in Bantam, the error message persisted<br/>
              •Back to fusion where Cindy Feng made a more agressive adjustment to retraction.<br/>
              •Back to Bantam, this time I hit the "start" button hoping to override the persisting error message. <br/>

            <p>
              Finally I was able to have progress milling. <br/>
              <br/>
              Note! I had to hit the emergency stop when almost to the end, the mill bit ARM (not the mill bit)<br/>
              made contact with my wax and began acting as a drill itself !!!(see the round cut out in my final mold).<br/>
              Hence the "retraction" warning : My wax block was slightly too deep/thick, despite fitting under the mill bit.

            I mixed up silicon at home and filled my mold.

            THIS part was easy. While I completed these steps 6 days ago—I had trouble connectint with the plaster product.<br/>
            I have attained plaster so ...CHECK BACK IN A DAY: miniature pyramid AKA teeny tiny pedastal, COMING SOON.
