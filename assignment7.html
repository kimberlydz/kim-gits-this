              The goal of this assignment is to create a mold for a plaster casting. The steps include <br/>
              first creating a mold from wax, to be used to create a mold from silicon, to be used for <br/>
              creating the object of desire in plaster.
              <br/>
              <br/>I looked for inspiration on Thingaverse. Thinking about the movement of the milling <br/>
              bit, I searched for ideas that didn't include an overhanging ledge. I chose a pyramid <br/>
              because of it's top down unfolding nature.

            I borrowed the native STL file created by __________from thingaverse and opened it in Rhino, <br/>
            where I had created a 3d mesh container that matched the size of a block of wax I intended <br/>
            to mill.
            <br/>
            <br/>
             In Rhino, I placed the pyramid inside my mesh container,in contact with its base. <br/>
             As a 'whole', I exported the file as a (STl) file, one step toward manifesting the file <br/>
             in G-Code, a language that the milling machine can interpret to carve my wax mold.<br/>

            I opened my STL file in Fusion 360 where I was able to create and see or 'verify' a <br/>
            milling tool path....But PIVOT. Nadia who was the makerspace saw my pyramid shape <br/>
            and made the observaton that my pyramid had tiny detailing, to detailed for the <br/>
            mill process to render.

            <p>
            I started over with looking for a simple iteration of a pyramid. I followed the <br/>
            same steps to produce a milling pattern for the pyramid pictured above.

            Once I opened the new pyramid in Fusion, I had an issue with the box that <br/>
            represents my object area to be milled (I think): it hovered away from my box <br/>
            I wasn't able to figure how to fix this, and was lucky to be at a makerspace where<br/>
            with a student nearby who had a foundation of knowledgeable about Fusion , who was <br/>
            very kind to help BUT even he became very frustrated. He believed the source of the <br/>
            problem was the mesh nature of my stl from Rhino.

            The solve for aligning the area with my file was...

              I adjusted settings per instructions shared by Nadia,...

            <p>
              and created a tool path that in my limited experience appeared to look good!<br/>
              I exported the G-Code.
