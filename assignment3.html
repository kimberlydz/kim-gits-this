            <p>I searched online for concepts based on a triangle shape.<br>
              I found this pic of a beautiful form accredited to Gearge W. Hart<br>
              and featured in a Quarky Science blog post.

            Referring to details about the individual piece provided in the blog post,I went to work<br>
            creating a vector grid to get the 20 triangles I needed = totally wrong geometry...My bad.

            <p>
            I quickly abandoned the grid to focus on creating the one piece I needed, a 3" equilateral triangle.<br>
            I added a 1" red rule to help me accurately place the required notches 1" from each corner. Using a<br>
            digital kaliper I learned my cardboard was 3mm thick, but when I added a notch of that dim to my triangle<br>
            it seemed much to wide relative to the area of the triangleâ€”which indicated to me that if I proceeded with<br>
            3mm cardboard I'd have trouble with construction. So I went dumpster diving for thinner card board and<br>
            hopefully more elegant solution in the end.
