            <p>I chose to create simple shapes to focus on learning Rhino/Grasshopper.The above images reflect my<br>
            final outcomes,a circle and hexagon with different thicknesses if materials (cardboard). I decided to add<br>
            making a second shape to test my understanding since I relied on help to learn the first go around. <br>

            I started with a creating a square using the Square component. However<br>
            I was unable to shift the square to have a centerpoint alignment<br>
            with the centerpoint of the xy radius on the Rhino canvas. A solve <br>
            may be starting with using the polygon component for the square, thinking,<br>
            a polygon is defined by radius and will generate a square from it's center point.<br>
            I think.

            I abandoned the square and created a circle using the polygon component.<br>
            -Next I added a Radius parameter with a maximum of 65mm for width.<br>
            -And as follows:<br>
            -A Rectangle component<br>
            -a number slider each for X and Y dimensions attached with the X and Y ports of the Rectangle.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            RELOCATING RECTANGLE ON THE SPHERE AND ABILITY TO RE-SIZE ELEMENTS<br>
            I was challenged to understand these next computational relationships which are required to create <br>
            radiating notches around the sphere—AND have the ability to change the geometry(rectangles and sphere)<br>
            simultaneously maintaining relativity of measurements or/and also— change dim's independently of one another.<br>
            With my colleagues help I achieved this as follows:<br>
            <br>
            MOVING RECTANGLE:<br>
            -I created a Move parameter to adjust rectangle/notch to locate it at the top center of the circle.<br>
            -added a X/Y Vector component to tell the rectangle which direction to move along<br>
            -I added a Subtract parameter to which I attached the Circle geometry and the Y dimension of the Rectangle.<br>
            <br>
            CHANGING DIMENSIONS RELATIVELY<br>
            -added a Multiply parameter<br>
            -and attached both a Number Slider and Number Parameter (which dictated the increment of the sldier)<br>
             to the above Multiply parameter.
             -I joined the Multiply parameter to the X/Y Vector parameter.<br>
             <br>
             At this point I attached the entire geometry to the Move parameter: attaching the Rectangle to the Geometry port<br>
             and the Vector to the T (motion) port. Which I then connected to a Polar Array parameter.<br>
             -A number slider was necessary to indictate the range of number of items in the polar array.<br>
             <br>
             The last step was creating the negative space of the notch by connecting the Polar Array rectangles and the<br>
             Sphere to a Region Difference component.
