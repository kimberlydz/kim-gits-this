            Cindy Feng and I discussed together to form a concept and began to build in Onshape. <br>
            I liked collaborating this way because being an engineer, she challenged my thinking for ways <br>
            to construct a box assembly—as well as how to implement the idea in OnShape.

            <p>
            From OnShape I exported as a DXF > opened in Kikad > opened in Bantam. Everything looked BTDwgCreate<br>
            as it appeared in Bantam. WRONG.

            Setting up for milling went smoothly however not entirely successful. While it cut through the edges were<br>
            "crusty" as a result of not a clean cut all the way through the copper.

            Cindy who was working ahead of my pace had milled the top/bottom design, and informed we the slots were too small, <br>
            and gave me a suggestion for what size the slots should be instead.

            </p>
            <p>
          At this point my project falls apart,literally—and I got kicked out of The Mill (closing time.) While the slots cut cleanly,<br>
           they were much to big. And the milling was not successful in that perimeter edge was crusty and cracking apart.<br>

            <p>
          REFLECTING BACK: I would begin with a different design plan. I'd use AI which I use frequently.

          SHOUT OUT—THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP<br>

          Cindy Feng !! who showed me new ways to construct in OnShape, and Leo who helped me think through settings for milling.
